Unit Testing Rules:
1. The maximum test scope is a class. Method calls to other external classes should be mocked.
2. Adhere to the 3A principle: Arrange, Act, Assert. Test methods must have 3A comments.
3. Assert phase: It is required to verify the implementation logic of the method and also that external class methods have been called.
4. Before executing the `mvn test` command, please run the `mvn formatter:format` command to format the code.
5. You only need to run the test for a single file after writing the unit test.

Response Rules:
1. Use Traditional Chinese Language
2. Use Taiwanese Terminology Preference

Executing commands in the terminal Rules:
1. The environment is PowerShell. Therefore, all commands must adhere to PowerShell syntax.
2. When specifying a file or folder path in a command, ensure that only the path itself is enclosed in double quotes. The rest of the command (such as the command name, options, etc.) does not need to be enclosed.
3. Before executing any command, you must navigate to the correct directory; failure to do so will result in errors.
